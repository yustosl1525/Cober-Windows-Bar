# Cober-Windows-Bar

Windows 11 Unified Status Hub for lightweight, glanceable desktop status.

Current release track: **v0.2 Interactive Event Playground**.

## Overview

Cober-Windows-Bar is a Windows 11-style Unified Status Hub. The long-term product idea is a small, native-feeling status surface above the taskbar that can summarize music, AI work, downloads, notifications, developer tasks, and agent activity without becoming a full dashboard.

The current implementation is still front-end only. It uses mock data and the local event playground to prove that the hub can move through meaningful states. It does not include Tauri, real system APIs, provider integrations, tray behavior, or always-on-top windowing.

## Current Capabilities

- Win11/Mica/Acrylic `/showcase` review page.
- Six hub states: Idle, Music, AI Progress, Download, Notification, MultiTask.
- v0.2 event controls for triggering mock status changes.
- Auto Demo flow for recording a short state-transition demo.
- Resolver visualization showing active events, resolver output, and current mode.
- QA commands for state tests, production build, and viewport screenshots.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Showcase entry:

```text
http://localhost:5173/showcase
```

Open the showcase directly:

```bash
npm run dev:showcase
```

Build and QA:

```bash
npm run build
npm run qa
```

Generate showcase screenshots after the dev server is running:

```bash
npm run qa:showcase:screenshots
```

Screenshots are written to `output/playwright/` and are local QA artifacts only.

## v0.2 Interactive Event Playground

The current v0.2 goal is to prove "this thing moves" before any provider or desktop-shell work.

Required controls:

- Music
- AI
- Download
- Notification
- MultiTask
- Clear / Idle
- Start Demo

Expected data flow:

```text
Event Controls -> publishHubEvent() -> store -> resolver -> resolved UI mode
```

Auto Demo should move through:

```text
Idle -> Music -> AI -> Notification -> Download -> MultiTask -> Idle
```

The resolver visualization should show:

- Active Events
- Current Mode
- A compact Events -> Resolver -> Resolved Mode flow

## v0.2.1 Validation & Polish

v0.2.1 focuses on making the playground ready for README/GitHub/demo capture. It does not add Provider SDK, Tauri, or real system integrations.

Planned lightweight showcase assets:

- `docs/screenshots/idle.png`
- `docs/screenshots/music.png`
- `docs/screenshots/ai.png`
- `docs/screenshots/download.png`
- `docs/screenshots/notification.png`
- `docs/screenshots/multitask.png`
- `docs/demo/event-playground.gif`

The GIF should loop a 10-15 second sequence:

```text
Idle -> Music -> AI -> Notification -> MultiTask
```

Large GIF/video binaries should not be committed without checking their size first.

## Product Route

- **Stage 0: UI Prototype** - done and pushed as v0.1.
- **Stage 1: Event Playground** - current v0.2 work; mock controls, auto demo, resolver visualization.
- **Stage 2: Provider SDK** - later; interfaces and fake providers only, no system integration.
- **Stage 3: Tauri Shell** - later; desktop shell and window behavior.
- **Stage 4: Real Providers** - later; system, music, download, notification, and AI task providers.
- **Stage 5: Developer Hub** - later; Git, Docker, WSL, Maven, Gradle, and related developer surfaces.
- **Stage 6: AI Agent Hub** - later; agent status, queue state, and long-running AI work visibility.
